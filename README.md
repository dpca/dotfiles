# dotfiles

Dotfiles and setup scripts to automate OS X setup. Largely inspired by
Thoughtbot's [laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) and
[dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) repos but modified to suit
my own needs.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dpca/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
~/dotfiles/setup/mac
```

Run `rcup` after adding new files to the directory to properly symlink them.
